📊 E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an e-commerce orders dataset using Python.
The goal is to clean the data, perform statistical analysis, and extract business-relevant insights through aggregation and visualization.

🧠 Key Objectives

Understand customer purchasing behavior
Analyze sales performance across regions, products, and time
Apply NumPy operations for numerical analysis
Practice real-world data cleaning and validation
Create clear visualizations to support insights

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas – data manipulation & grouping
NumPy – numerical computations
Matplotlib – data visualization

📂 Dataset Details

File: ecommerce_orders.csv
Records: 100 orders

Columns:

OrderID
CustomerID
Product
Quantity
Price
OrderDate
Region
PaymentMode
TotalAmount

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

✔ Checked missing values (no critical nulls found)
✔ Removed duplicate orders using OrderID
✔ Validated no negative values in Quantity or Price
✔ Converted OrderDate to datetime format
✔ Normalized numerical data using Min-Max Scaling

📈 Analysis Performed
🔹 Descriptive Statistics

Mean & Median of product quantities
Minimum & Maximum product prices

🔹 Revenue Analysis

Revenue per order using NumPy arrays
Highest value orders identified

🔹 Customer Analysis

Orders per customer
Identification of high-frequency customers

🔹 Regional Performance

Average Order Value (AOV) by region
Total sales contribution by region

🔹 Product Insights

Unique products sold
Product-wise revenue contribution

🔹 Time-Based Analysis

Orders per day
Sales trends over time
Date-range filtering for targeted analysis

📊 Visualizations Created

📈 Sales Over Time (Line Chart)
📊 Total Sales by Region (Bar Chart)
🥧 Product Sales Distribution (Pie Chart)
📦 Order Value Distribution by Region (Box Plot)

📉 Daily Order Volume Trend

Each visualization is designed to answer a specific business question clearly.

💡 Key Insights

North & South regions generate higher average order values
High-priced products significantly impact total revenue
Certain customers place frequent repeat orders
Sales remain consistent over time with identifiable peak day

📌 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with realistic business data
Strong understanding of EDA workflow
Improved ability to translate data into insights
Portfolio-ready Python analytics project
